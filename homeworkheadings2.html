    Here's what I like about lists:
    
    <ul>
        <li> They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
    </ul>

    When you make a list, do it in this order:

    <ol> 
        <li> Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
        <li> If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
        <li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
        </ul>
        <li>I've got this!</li>
    </ol>
    </div>

        <h1>Here's a couple ways you can express yourself</h1>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here</li>
            <li><i>If you want to sound intertesting, try italics</i></li>
            <li><b>if you wabt to sound annoying, try bold</b></li>
        </ul>

        I did it! I am proud!
